# Decisions

A running log of notable decisions made while developing this app, and the
reasoning behind them — so future sessions don't relitigate settled questions
without knowing why they were settled. Newest entries at the top.

## 2026-06-07 — Use `dvh` instead of `vh`/`screen` for full-height screens

**Decision:** Switched `HomeScreen` and `MultipleChoiceScreen` from
`min-h-screen` (`100vh`) to `min-h-dvh`/`h-dvh`. Also restructured
`MultipleChoiceScreen` so the question/options area scrolls internally
(`overflow-y-auto` + `min-h-0` on the flex item) inside a fixed `h-dvh`
container, keeping the close button, progress bar, and `FeedbackBar`
(with its Continue/Finish button) always pinned within the visible area.

**Why:** On mobile browsers, `100vh` reflects the viewport height with the
browser chrome (address bar, gesture nav) hidden — which is taller than
what's actually visible when that chrome is shown. That made the bottom of
`MultipleChoiceScreen` (crucially, the Continue/Finish button) render below
the visible fold, looking cut off with no obvious way to reach it. `dvh`
units track the *current* visible viewport, and the internal-scroll layout
guarantees the action button stays reachable regardless of content height
or browser-chrome state.

## 2026-06-07 — Deploy to GitHub Pages via Actions, with hardcoded `base`

**Decision:** Set `base: '/testapp005/'` in `vite.config.js` and added
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds on push to `main` and publishes
`dist/` using the official `actions/upload-pages-artifact` +
`actions/deploy-pages` flow (requires the repo's Pages source to be set to
"GitHub Actions" once in Settings → Pages).

**Why:** GitHub Pages serves project sites from `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`,
so asset URLs need the repo-name prefix — Vite's `base` handles rewriting both
the build output and dev-time references. Hardcoded the repo name rather than
deriving it (e.g. from `process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY`) since this app isn't
expected to be renamed or forked under a different name; if that changes,
update `base` to match.

## 2026-06-07 — Extracted pure lesson logic into `src/lessonLogic.js`

**Decision:** Moved `computeStars`, `recordResult`, `getUnlockedLessonIds`,
`shuffle`, `generateQuestions`, and `exerciseReducer` out of `App.jsx` into a
new `src/lessonLogic.js` module.

**Why:** Wanted to unit-test these pure functions directly, but exporting
non-component functions from `App.jsx` trips the
`react-refresh/only-export-components` ESLint rule (it breaks Fast Refresh).
Splitting them out also keeps `App.jsx` focused on components/screens and
makes the logic easier to reason about and test in isolation as the app grows.

## 2026-06-07 — Added unit/component tests (Vitest + RTL), held off on e2e

**Decision:** Set up Vitest + React Testing Library for unit and component
tests (`src/logic.test.js`, `src/App.test.jsx`). Did not add an end-to-end
suite (e.g. Playwright) yet.

**Why:** The riskiest logic — scoring, lesson unlocking, progress persistence,
question generation, the exercise state machine — is pure and cheap to unit
test directly. E2e tests are the slowest and most maintenance-heavy layer of
the testing pyramid; worth adding once the app grows more complex multi-screen
flows that are worth protecting end-to-end (e.g. once periphrastic verbs,
dialect variants, or more navigation land). Playwright + a working Chromium
are already available in the dev container if/when we revisit this.

## 2026-06-07 — Added CI (GitHub Actions: lint, test, build)

**Decision:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and
`npm run build` on every push and pull request.

**Why:** An automated gate is what actually *prevents* regressions from
landing — relying on remembering to run checks locally doesn't scale as the
app evolves and more changes land via agents.

## 2026-06-07 — SessionStart hook installs deps synchronously

**Decision:** `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` runs `npm install`
synchronously (not in async mode) on Claude Code web sessions, gated on
`$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`.

**Why:** Guarantees dependencies are installed before the agent starts
working, avoiding race conditions where it might try to lint/test/run before
`node_modules` exists. Tradeoff: session start is gated on `npm install`
completing. Can switch to async mode later if startup latency becomes
annoying — see the `session-start-hook` skill.
